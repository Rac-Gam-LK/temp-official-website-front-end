                            <p class="project-description p">The Colombo Meetup, was one of the best opportunities which
                                all the club members got a chance to connect with each other. From 10 in the morning
                                until 4 in the afternoon, the place was alive with laughter and excitement.
                                We were surrounded by nature, which made everything even better. We played that brought
                                us nostalgic memories of school days where we had so much fun.
                                The sound of our laughter and cheers filled the air, showing just how much we enjoyed
                                being together. We left with happy memories and a stronger sense of belonging to our
                                community.
